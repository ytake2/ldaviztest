homecare safety and medication management: a scoping  of the quantitative and qualitative evidence.,"  safety is a current national and international priority, and one of the most prevalent, highrisk fields within  safety is medication safety.14 the links in the chain of events necessary for medication safety include assessment, prescription, dispensing, and monitoring of medications. a weakness in any one of these essential links or a tenuous connection between links may  in an adverse event and harm to the . while medication safety in general demands consideration, there is a critical gap in our understanding of medication safety in the home care sector. understanding what factors contribute to, and/or reduce the risk of adverse drug events in the home setting will enable the identification and promotion of safer medication administration practices. key definitions homecare  and  is rife with inconsistent terminology related to roles. thus, discussion of medication safety in homecare necessitates clarification of terms. for the  of this discussion, caregivers refers to family members or friends in a paid or unpaid role who are responsible for or charged with caring for the . family members are individuals identified by the  and/or caregiver as being close to the  through blood, legal, or emotional ties, and who may or may not reside in the same home as the . finally, providers are employees of organizations providing homecare services. providers may be professionals or nonprofessionals, and regulated or unregulated (e.g. case managers, nurses, aides, pharmacists, and therapists.) compromised medication safety for older adults when medications are not managed safely, the associated costs for , their caregivers/families, providers, and the healthcare  can be severe.410 there is limited evidence from the international  on safety in homecare or safety in medication management in home care. , canadian  indicate that as many as one in five hospitalized canadians suffer adverse events following their discharge home, and two thirds of those events are related to compromised medication safety.1113 furthermore,  themselves have identified problematic  related to insufficient medication safety processes. for example, in the commonwealth survey (2002), 11% of canadian   that they received an incorrect medication at least once.14 medication safety issues are often augmented for older adults. management of multiple chronic illnesses as well as other care needs frequently compounds the complexity of the medication regimens common in this population. in canada‟s seniors, the total annual cost of preventable drugrelated morbidity (pdrm) was estimated to be $11 billion in 2000.7 in addition, a recent  observed that up to one in 11 seniors in halifax, nova scotia experienced a pdrm within a twoyear period.15 many of these lapses in medication safety occur in ‟ homes. because of the myriad of issues faced by elderly homecare recipients, this  will focus on medication safety issues for older adults who receive homecare services, their caregivers/families, and providers. complexity of care in the home homecare is inherently complex, and the demands on the knowledge, ability, energy, and finances of  and their families/caregivers are intensifying as a  of increasing acuity of , decreasing length of hospital stays, and increasing availability of mobile health care technology such as peritoneal and hemodialysis, long term intravenous catheters, and oxygen/inhalation therapy.16 family relationships, the home environment, which is not designed for providing health care, and the cognitive and physical abilities of both  and caregivers further influence care provision. while inhospital, care is predominantly the responsibility of regulated professional providers who work in shifts whereas unregulated providers, family, and caregivers provide much of the care in private homes.17 caregivers for home care  are frequently elderly, and they often grapple with health challenges of their own in addition to lack of sleep as they provide aroundtheclock care with little assistance or relief. family and caregivers often agree to care for  at home out of love and/or a sense of responsibility, but are unaware of the extent of the commitment involved and the drastic impact it can have on their own lives and health.18;19 additionally, providers who work in ‟ homes are exposed to the risks inherent in providing care alone in an unregulated and potentially illequipped setting. thus, the safety of the , caregiver/family, and provider are inextricably linked, and the care and safety of  around medication management cannot be addressed without including caregivers, family members, and providers in the equation.2022 medication safety in homecare current medication safety  focuses predominantly on institutions and paid providers. this  may have little applicability to the homecare setting, just as the traditional means of identifying and describing medication errors (e.g. “drug without indication” or “indication without drug”23) may be neither sufficient nor practical for homecare.24 assessing medicationrelated problems in the home often demands consideration of issues that are often irrelevant in the hospital setting. examples of these are economic issues, such as whether the  can afford to fill his or her prescriptions; access issues, such as whether the  has the physical c to get to a pharmacy; and social issues, such as living with an overwhelmed caregiver who has his or her own health concerns. additionally, there is a great deal of variation in the abilities of caregivers, many of whom are lay people with no formal health care training. there is little in the way of education or preparation for these caregivers, who manage an array of medications in potentially illequipped home settings, frequently while under the influence of stress and fatigue. though providers can help to alleviate risks through assessment and collaborative discussions with  and caregivers, the nature of the home setting requires  and caregivers to make frequent autonomous decisions about medication use with minimal professional supervision, and deficient or absent home and community supports.17 in addition, the home setting presents unique difficulties in documentation and communication related to medications.  shows points of transfer across sectors already hold increased challenges in these essential functions.1113;25 one related danger to homecare  is the implications of insufficient communication for medication reconciliation, defined as the “ and comprehensive  of all the medications a  is taking to ensure that medications being added, changed or discontinued are carefully assessed and documented.”26,p.5 as the potential for receiving inappropriate medication increases, so too does the potential for harmful incidents (an incident which  in harm to a ).27,p.23 shifting perspective: new knowledge requirements homecare continues to be chronically underfunded within a health care  dominated by the acute care setting, despite an everincreasing demand for homecare services. health care strategies for the elderly, including seniors with chronic  and those that need endoflife care, require a fundamental change in perspective. this change is necessary from a shortterm, diseaseoriented perspective with an emphasis on diagnosis and , as well as from a longterm perspective with an emphasis on functional c, health maintenance, prevention of further deterioration, health promotion for the  and caregivers/families, as well as comfort and supportive care. this shift in perspective calls for a new set of competencies (education, skills), and alternative approaches (including behavioral strategies) to care for these  and caregivers/families. the safety implications for medication management in home care need to be addressed in relation to service provision for vulnerable  (i.e., elderly, chronically and/or terminally ill), ethical considerations for the myriad of daily decisions in homecare, and the critical role of , caregivers, and family members as integral members of the health care delivery team. in line with the view proposed by the canadian institutes for health  (cihr), “decisionmakers need information and implementation strategies on how to shift from a world of acute care solutions for chronic care needs to a world of chronic care solutions for chronic care needs,”28 this  will explore existing knowledge related to medication management from a safety perspective for older adults receiving home care as well as their caregivers, families and providers.  existing  related to the issues and challenges faced by this population, as well as any strategies used to mitigate or ameliorate safety risks, will illuminate gaps in current knowledge, identify priority  areas, and advance  safety

health anxiety and illness behaviour in children of mothers with severe health anxiety,"excessive health anxiety, still designated as hypochondriasis in icd10, refers to worries and anxiety about harbouring serious illness. it is common in both primary and secondary health care with prevalence rates up to 9% and causes great suffering for the individual as well as high health care costs when untreated. growing  suggests that health anxiety may originate in childhood, and  have demonstrated that cognitive and behavioural features similar to those described for health anxiety in adults may be present. the development of health anxiety probably has a complex nature involving a number of interacting factors such as genetics and environmental factors. a few  have highlighted a possible transmission of health anxiety symptoms from a parent to a child and found significant associations between child and parental self health anxiety symptoms. theoretical perspectives also assume an association between childhood experiences and family factors and a later development of health anxiety. this dissertation is  on a   and a family case  and aims to answer the following questions: 1) what is the empirical evidence for the influence of childhood and family factors for the development of health anxiety? 2) does exposure to severe maternal health anxiety contribute to health anxiety symptoms in their children or perhaps more broadly affect the children emotionally? 3) do mothers with severe health anxiety express more health anxiety on behalf of their child, more maladaptive illness perceptions and behaviours compared to mothers with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy mothers? the first part, the  , was performed in accordance with the  statement and focused on the current empirical evidence for childhood and family factors involved in the development of health anxiety. in total 25  were  emanating from 23 . the ,  on this limited , suggested potential relationships between the development of health anxiety and 1) the intergenerational transmission, i.e. from parent to child, of health anxiety symptoms, 2) early childhood experience involving illness and 3) the expression of an anxious attachment style. the second part, the family case , adds to the limited knowledge of health anxiety symptoms in childhood with one  presenting original  on health anxiety, related symptoms and illness behaviour in three  of children exposed to different maternal health status. another   the phenomenon of maternal health anxiety by proxy in mothers with severe health anxiety. the  for these two  stem from 150 families with a child in the age  817 years. these were  into a case  of children of mothers with severe health anxiety and two  ; children of mothers with rheumatoid arthritis and children of healthy mothers. the children completed a questionnaire battery including items on health anxiety and related constructs. the mothers and fathers filled in questionnaires regarding their own mental and physical health including health anxiety, and the mothers moreover filled in questionnaires regarding illness perceptions, illness worries and illness behaviour related to their children. the findings suggest that severe maternal health anxiety only weakly affects children's own  of health anxiety symptoms and hence may not be a strong risk factor for the development and clinical presentation of excessive health anxiety symptoms early in life, i.e. in children aged 817 years. , mothers with severe health anxiety perceived their children as having more emotional and physical symptoms compared to mothers with ra and healthy mothers and accordingly more often took their child to see a doctor compared to mothers with rheumatoid arthritis. they  a more negative illness perception and more health anxiety on behalf of their child, i.e. health anxiety by proxy, as well as more dissatisfaction with their medical consultation in general practice regarding their child compared to mothers with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy mothers. thus, although we in the first  did not find that the children of mothers with severe health anxiety themselves  more physical symptoms compared to children in the  , the findings of the second  raise the possibility that the upbringing by a parent with negative illness perceptions and health anxiety in the long run could learn the child that minor bodily changes (i.e. feeling unwell) are unusual and need extra attention. targeting health anxiety by proxy in the  of mothers who suffer from severe health anxiety may therefore be important to prevent not only iatrogenic harm to the child but also the exposure of the child to a maladaptive illness behaviour, which potentially could be a risk factor for the child to develop this behaviour itself when growing up.",2017

tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus nonsurgical management for obstructive sleepdisordered breathing in children,": obstructive sleepdisordered breathing (osdb) is a  that encompasses breathing problems when asleep, due to an obstruction of the upper airways, ranging in severity from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (osas). it affects both children and adults. in children, hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoid tissue is thought to be the commonest cause of osdb. as such, tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy is considered an appropriate firstline  for most cases of paediatric osdb. objectives: to assess the benefits and harms of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy compared with nonsurgical management of children with osdb.  : we  the  register of  online, , em, cinahl, web of science, clinical.gov, ictrp and additional sources for  and un . the date of the  was 5 march 2015. selection criteria:    comparing the  and safety of (adeno)tonsillectomy with nonsurgical management in children with osdb aged 2 to 16 years.  collection and : we used the standard  procedures expected by the  collaboration. main : three  (562 children) met our inclusion criteria. two were at moderate to high risk of bias and one at low risk of bias. we did not pool the  because of substantial clinical heterogeneity. they evaluated three different  of children: those diagnosed with mild to moderate osas by polysomnography (psg) (453 children aged five to nine years; low risk of bias; chat ), those with a clinical diagnosis of osdb but with negative psg recordings (29 children aged two to 14 years; moderate to high risk of bias; goldstein) and children with down syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis (mps) diagnosed with mild to moderate osas by psg (80 children aged six to 12 years; moderate to high risk of bias; sudarsan). moreover, the  included two different comparisons: adenotonsillectomy versus no surgery (chat  and goldstein) or versus continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) (sudarsan). diseasespecific quality of life and/or symptom score (using a validated instrument): first primary  in the largest  with lowest risk of bias (chat ), at seven months, mean scores for those instruments measuring diseasespecific quality of life and/or symptoms were lower (that is, better quality of life or fewer symptoms) in children receiving adenotonsillectomy than in those managed by watchful : osa18 questionnaire (scale 18 to 126): 31.8 versus 49.5 (mean difference (md) 17.7, 95% confidence  (ci) 21.2 to 14.2);psqsrbd questionnaire (scale 0 to 1): 0.2 versus 0.5 (md 0.3, 95% ci 0.31 to 0.26);modified epworth sleepiness scale (scale 0 to 24): 5.1 versus 7.1 (md 2.0, 95% ci 2.9 to 1.1). no  on this primary  were  in the goldstein . in the sudarsan , the mean osa18 score at 12 months did not significantly differ between the adenotonsillectomy and cpap . the mean modified epworth sleepiness scale scores did not differ at six months, but were lower in the surgery  at 12 months: 5.5 versus 7.9 (md 2.4, 95% ci 3.1 to 1.7). adverse events: second primary  in the chat , 15 children experienced a serious adverse event: 6/194 (3%) in the adenotonsillectomy  and 9/203 (4%) in the   (rd 1%, 95% ci 5% to 2%). no major complications were  in the goldstein . in the sudarsan , 2/37 (5%) developed a secondary haemorrhage after adenotonsillectomy, while 1/36 (3%) developed a rash on the nasal dorsum secondary to the cpap mask (rd 3%, 95% ci 6% to 12%). secondary  in the chat , at seven months, mean scores for generic caregiverrated quality of life were higher in children receiving adenotonsillectomy than in those managed by watchful . no  on this  were  by sudarsan and goldstein. in the chat , at seven months, more children in the surgery  had normalisation of respiratory events during sleep as measured by psg than those allocated to watchful : 153/194 (79%) versus 93/203 (46%) (rd 33%, 95% ci 24% to 42%). in the goldstein , at six months, psg recordings were similar between  and in the sudarsan  resolution of osas (apnoea/hypopnoea index score below 1) did not significantly differ between the adenotonsillectomy and cpap . in the chat , at seven months, neurocognitive performance and attention and executive function had not improved with surgery: scores were similar in both . in the chat , at seven months, mean scores for caregiver ratings of behaviour were lower (that is, better behaviour) in children receiving adenotonsillectomy than in those managed by watchful , , teacher ratings of behaviour did not significantly differ. no  on these  were  by goldstein and sudarsan. ' : in otherwise healthy children, without a syndrome, of older age (five to nine years), and diagnosed with mild to moderate osas by psg, there is moderate quality evidence that adenotonsillectomy provides benefit in terms of quality of life, symptoms and behaviour as rated by caregivers and high quality evidence that this procedure is beneficial in terms of psg parameters. at the same time, high quality evidence indicates no benefit in terms of objective measures of attention and neurocognitive performance compared with watchful . furthermore, psg recordings of almost half of the children managed nonsurgically had normalised by seven months, indicating that physicians and parents should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of adenotonsillectomy against watchful  in these children. this is a  that may recover spontaneously over time. for nonsyndromic children classified as having osdb on purely clinical grounds but with negative psg recordings, the evidence on the  of adenotonsillectomy is of very low quality and is inconclusive. lowquality evidence suggests that adenotonsillectomy and cpap may be equally  in children with down syndrome or mps diagnosed with mild to moderate osas by psg. we are unable to present  on the benefits of adenotonsillectomy in children with osdb aged under five, despite this being a population in whom this procedure is often performed for this .",2015
